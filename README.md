# Machine-Learning
Welcome to the Machine Learning Repository. This repository contains the code and deployment for the Machine Learning Project. We create a Tensorflow Model to predict the fruits and vegetables freshness. Furthermore, we will also provide a recommender system according to user needs.

## Project Description
We will build a model to classify fruits and vegetables with a total of 20 classes (5 fresh fruits, 5 rotten fruits, 5 fresh vegetables, 5 rotten vegetables). Then, we build a baseline model using a pre-trained model or transfer learning by MobileNetV2. The model was saved with model.pb and we choose that for next deployment.

## Datasets
We use datasets from Kaggle which contains 2 folders:
- Fruits (5997 images for 10 classes)
- Vegetables (6003 images for 10 classes)

This dataset was gathered from different online sources, such as Google images, Bing images, Kaggle, Fruit360, and Sriram R.K. Here is the link:

## Case
Here are the two main features we developed in our project:
- Fruits & vegetables classification
- Menu recommendations for fruit and vegetable products

## Features 
The following are some of the features we have developed in developing the model:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preprocessing Data and Image
- Image Augmentantation
- Callbacks
- Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2

## Prerequisites
Most of the activities in this project we do based on using Google services.
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory
- Python version 3.9 or above
- Tensorflow version 2.12 or above
