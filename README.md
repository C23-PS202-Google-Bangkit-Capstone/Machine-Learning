# Machine-Learning
Welcome to the Machine Learning Repository. This repository contains the code and deployment for the Machine Learning Project. We create a Tensorflow Model to predict the fruits and vegetables freshness.

## Project Description
We will build a model to classify fruits and vegetables with a total of 34 classes. Then, we build a baseline model using a pre-trained model or transfer learning by MobileNetV2. We develop 3x models and it is decided that model improve 3 are our fix model. The model was saved with .pb and .h5 format and then converted into TFLite format. Next, we choose that for next deployment.

## Datasets
The model is created using a combination of dataset from Kaggle and Mendeley with some manually sourced data. Our fixed dataset is named Pt4Custom_Fruits&Vegetables dataset. Here is the link:

For kaggle dataset, this dataset was gathered from different online sources, such as Google Images, Bing Images, Kaggle, Fruit360, and Sriram R.K. Here is the link:

## Case
Here are the three main features we developed in our project:
- App that could scan a lot of different types of fruits and veggies, both common and specialized in Indonesia
- Menu recommendations based on their location or age (if user has logged on)
- An explanation why an item is considered rotten based on the image

## Features 
The following are some of the features we have developed in developing the model:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preprocessing Data and Image
- Image Augmentation
- Callbacks
- Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2

## Prerequisites
Most of the activities in this project we do based on using Google services.
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory
- Python version 3.9 or above
- Tensorflow version 2.12 or above
